# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Using NLP  

This repository contains a project on **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to identify and classify named entities in a text into predefined categories such as **Person**, **Organization**, **Location**, **Date**, **Time**, **Money**, and more.  

NER has various real-world applications, such as information extraction, search engines, and customer sentiment analysis. This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for building and training an NER model using state-of-the-art NLP techniques.

## Project Overview  

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial task in NLP that involves extracting structured information from unstructured text. This project showcases the implementation of NER using both rule-based methods and machine learning techniques, including pre-trained models like **SpaCy** and fine-tuning transformer-based models like **BERT**.

## Features  

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Tokenization and sentence segmentation.  
  - Annotation of named entities in training datasets.  

- **Rule-Based NER**:  
  - Custom rules for entity recognition using **regular expressions** and keyword matching.  

- **Machine Learning-Based NER**:  
  - Implemented CRF (Conditional Random Fields) and LSTM-CRF models.  

- **Transformer-Based NER**:  
  - Fine-tuning **BERT**, **RoBERTa**, or **DistilBERT** for improved entity recognition.  

- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - Precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.  

- **Deployment**:  
  - Flask API for deploying the NER model.  
  - Simple web interface to input text and visualize recognized entities.

## Usage  

1. **Rule-Based NER**:  
   - Run the `rule_based_ner.py` script for custom rule-based recognition.  

2. **Train a Custom Model**:  
   - Train a CRF or LSTM-based model using the `train_model.py` script.  

   ```bash  
   python train_model.py  
   ```  

3. **Fine-Tune a Transformer Model**:  
   - Use the `transformer_ner.py` script to fine-tune a transformer-based model like BERT.  

   ```bash  
   python transformer_ner.py  
   ```  

4. **Deploy the Model**:  
   - Run the Flask app for real-time NER predictions.  

   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```
